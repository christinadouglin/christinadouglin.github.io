I graduated from LBJ Early College High School with my diploma along with an Associate of Arts in General Studies. I currently am a freshman at The University of Texas at Austin. I plan to declare my major in Marketing and I also am double majoring in Human Dimensions of Organizations. I would like to pursue a career in brand management within the consumer goods field, particularly the beauty industry. In my spare time, I enjoy watching Netflix and shopping!</p>
